                <p>Hi, welcome aboard. For obvious reasons, this plane is not a Boeing 737. My name is <strong>Abdulhaqq Omoyele</strong> and I'm a creative content writer and strategist, noob frontend developer (the proof is in the pudding), journalist and student. In case it's not already clear, I love telling stories. I have experience working on small marketing teams at Smarketers Hub and Murtadore Digital where I contributed across writing, strategy and social media. All of my other experience has been through freelance and ghostwriting. </p>
